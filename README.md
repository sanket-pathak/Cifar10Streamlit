# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNN

This project demonstrates a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset for multi-class image classification.

## Features
- CNN-based image classifier
- Streamlit web interface
- Upload an image and get predicted class

## Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Streamlit

## Dataset
CIFAR-10 (60,000 32×32 RGB images across 10 classes)

## How it works
The model extracts spatial features using convolution and pooling layers
and predicts the most probable class using a softmax output layer.
